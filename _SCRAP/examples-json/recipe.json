{ "name": "Healthy Chicken Salad", "description": "Healthy Chicken Salad is a nutritious and flavorful dish that typically consists of cooked and diced chicken breast, mixed with various fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and sometimes fruits like grapes or apples. The salad is often dressed with a light vinaigrette or yogurt-based dressing to keep it on the healthier side, avoiding heavy mayonnaise or cream-based dressings. Additional ingredients like nuts, seeds, or herbs might be added for extra texture and flavor. This salad is known for being high in protein and low in unhealthy fats, making it a popular choice for those on a health-conscious diet. It can be served as a main course or a side dish and is often enjoyed as a refreshing meal option, especially during the warmer months.", "preparationTime": 20, "cookingTime": 10, "difficulty": "easy", "cookingTips": "This dish is full of nutrients, including heart-healthy omega-3 acids, fibre and vitamins C nd K", "servingSuggestions": "Vary up the salad to suit your taste, try adding radish, diced cucumber or edamame beans", "leftoverStorage": "Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.", "cuisine": "International", "course": "Main Course", "diet": "High Protein", "tags": ["healthy","salad","protein","fruit","chicken"], "ingredients": [{ "ingredient": { "name": "chicken breast", "calories": 166.2, "carbohydrates_total_g": 0, "cholesterol_mg": 85, "fat_saturated_g": 1, "fat_total_g": 3.5, "fiber_g": 0, "potassium_mg": 226, "protein_g": 31, "serving_size_g": 100, "sodium_mg": 72, "sugar_g": 0 }, "quantity": 200 }, { "ingredient": { "name": "tomato", "calories": 18.2, "carbohydrates_total_g": 3.9, "cholesterol_mg": 0, "fat_saturated_g": 0, "fat_total_g": 0.2, "fiber_g": 1.2, "potassium_mg": 23, "protein_g": 0.9, "serving_size_g": 100, "sodium_mg": 4, "sugar_g": 2.6 }, "quantity": 100 }, { "ingredient": { "name": "lettuce", "calories": 17, "carbohydrates_total_g": 3.3, "cholesterol_mg": 0, "fat_saturated_g": 0, "fat_total_g": 0.3, "fiber_g": 2.1, "potassium_mg": 30, "protein_g": 1.2, "serving_size_g": 100, "sodium_mg": 7, "sugar_g": 1.2 }, "quantity": 100 }, { "ingredient": { "name": "cherry tomatoes", "calories": 17.8, "carbohydrates_total_g": 3.9, "cholesterol_mg": 0, "fat_saturated_g": 0, "fat_total_g": 0.2, "fiber_g": 1.2, "potassium_mg": 23, "protein_g": 0.9, "serving_size_g": 100, "sodium_mg": 5, "sugar_g": 2.6 }, "quantity": 50 }, { "ingredient": { "name": "cucumber", "calories": 15.3, "carbohydrates_total_g": 3.7, "cholesterol_mg": 0, "fat_saturated_g": 0, "fat_total_g": 0.1, "fiber_g": 0.5, "potassium_mg": 24, "protein_g": 0.6, "serving_size_g": 100, "sodium_mg": 1, "sugar_g": 1.7 }, "quantity": 50 }, { "ingredient": { "name": "olive oil", "__v": 0, "calories": 869.2, "carbohydrates_total_g": 0, "cholesterol_mg": 0, "fat_saturated_g": 13.9, "fat_total_g": 101.2, "fiber_g": 0, "potassium_mg": 0, "protein_g": 0, "serving_size_g": 100, "sodium_mg": 1, "sugar_g": 0 }, "quantity": 20 }, { "ingredient": { "name": "balsamic", "calories": 89.1, "carbohydrates_total_g": 17.3, "cholesterol_mg": 0, "fat_saturated_g": 0, "fat_total_g": 0, "fiber_g": 0, "potassium_mg": 19, "protein_g": 0.5, "serving_size_g": 100, "sodium_mg": 22, "sugar_g": 14.9 }, "quantity": 20 }], "instructions": ["Grill the chicken breast and let it cool", "Chop all the vegetables and combine them in a large bowl", "Chop all the vegetables and combine them in a large bowl", "Slice the cooled chicken and add it to the bowl", " Drizzle with olive oil and balsamic, then toss well and serve"] }
